HubbleWP is a clean responsive business and portfolio Wordpress template built with Bootstrap. This Wordpress theme was built for professional businesses and developers to have a clean slate to work from. Simply add your own content and you're ready to roll.

We aimed to make installing this theme easy for all users by including fully featured documentation.

We've added a custom option panel so you can update your site easily and with no hassle.

In the Wordpress version of the HubbleWP template we have added some cool new features such as an upgraded CSS3 pricing table page and a portfolio page type. You can have as many portfolio pieces as you'd like using custom post types.

Using CSS3 we gave this template a subtle fading header and some awesome zoom effects on the portfolio and pricing pages to WOW your users.

We have built in a contact page in HubbleWP so you won't have to install any plugins.
